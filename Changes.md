Change log
==========

**Version 0.8**

* Updated charter to reflect the discussion at the Rutgers 7/11-9/1 2015 meeting.

* Basic format rules
	* Datablock name must now start with 'nef_'
	* All sf_framecode must now start with the name of the corresponding
		sf_category
	* '?' is no longer supported to mean 'not set' - all unset parameters must
		now be given as '.', which translates as null (None)
	* mandatory and optional tags and key columns for loops defined and given in
		Commented_Example.nef
	* The convention of starting references to saveframes with a '$' is NOT 
		supported any longer.
	* added ordinal column to peak and restraint lists to provide unique
		identifier for each line

**Version 0.7**

1. **Global nef name space**. All tags now start with '_nef_'.

2. **RCSB Amino acid variant codes**

  The RCSB variant codes consist of three parts, connected by underscores:

  - The amino acid three-letter code

  - the backbone linking, with twelve alternatives:
    * 'LL' : L-amino acid, middle position
    * 'LSN3' : L-amino acid, N-terminal -NH3+
    * 'LEO2' : L-amino acid, C-terminal COO-
    * 'LEO2H' : L-amino acid, C-terminal  COOH
    * 'LFZW' : L-amino acid, free zwitterion
    * 'LFOH' : L-amino acid, free COOH,NH2 form

    And six equivalent forms starting with 'D' for D-amino acids.

  - The side chain protonation state.

   The default is the fully protonated form (no third field).

   A missing proton is indicated by DHxy, where Hxy is the proton name.

      For NEF the standard forms are with charged Glutamate, Aspartate, Lysine,
      and Arginine side chains and charged N and C termini. These need not be
      indicated. The cases you might want to indicate (enclosed in '\*\* in the table)
      are protonated Aspartate, di-sulfide or deprotonated Cysteine, protonated
      Glutamate, double protonated Histidine, neutral HE-protonated Histidine,
      neutral Lysine, and O-linked (or deprotonated) Serine, Threonine, or
      Tyrosine.  These are the codes that programs should consider using.
      You would also want to indicate cis-Proline, but there are no RCSB codes
      for that situation (as far as we could tell), so we invented them (John
      Westbrook!?).

      The more common variant codes are given in the table below. I have omitted
      free amino acid forms and side chain deprotonated ARG and TRP.
      Non-standard variant codes that should be used where relevant, are enclosed in '\*\*'.
      In all other cases, the short three-letter residue-type will suffice.

3. Indirect magnetisation transfer

      We have added a new tag to the spectrum_dimension_transfer loop, so that it becomes e.g.

      ```
      loop_
        _nef_spectrum_dimension_transfer.dimension_1
        _nef_spectrum_dimension_transfer.dimension_2
        _nef_spectrum_dimension_transfer.transfer_type
        _nef_spectrum_dimension_transfer.is_indirect

        1 3 through-space  true
        2 3 onebond  false
      stop_
      ```

    The is_indirect tag would be used for transfers that are relayed through other nuclei. The relevant cases are
    the ChhC NOESY (used in solid state NMR) or 3D CCH HSQC-NOESY-HSQC, where the transfer being measured is a
    proton-proton NOESY, but the nucleus observed is actually carbon.

4. We have added a proposal for representing tensors (for use in e.g. RDC restraint lists), including a format for the tensor value, and a system of dummy residues to hold the tensor orientation. Please see the Questions document for details
