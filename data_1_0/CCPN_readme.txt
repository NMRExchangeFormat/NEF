CCPN test data
==============

CCPN_H1GI_clean.nef and CCPN_Sec5Part3.nef 
------------------------------------------

are both CCPN 'working projects'. They are the export of a complete project as it would accumulate
(minus any CCPN-specific tags), rather than the smaller and more targeted files you would
produce for transfer to a specific program or depositions system. Not all the content will be
relevant for all other programs, but this is the kind of files you may encounter.

CCPN_H1GI_clean.nef is a mature project with assignnments, assigned peaks, restraints, 
peak-restraint links, and the results of violation analysis.

CCPN_Sec5Part3.nef is an early project with the kind of assignments you would expect while
still assigning the spectrum.

CCPN_H1GI_clean_extended.nef
----------------------------

is the same file as CCPN_H1GI_clean.nef, cpntaining the same data, but in addition contains the 
ccpn-specific tags used to store complete ccpn projects.


For an example that exercises all the tags in the format, use 
specification/Commented_Example.nef
