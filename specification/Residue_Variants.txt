# This file lists the standard residues (20 amino acids, 4 RNA, 4 DNA) that must be
# supported by NEF-conforming programs.
# For each is listed all atom names,
# standard pseudoatom names, and supported variant codes
# 'Additional atoms' are atoms that are part of the RCSB template 
# but not of the default, pH 7 form.

# Each residue is given as the linking ('middle') form. 'start' and 'end' residues are 
# dealt with separately at the bottom of the file.

# Note that the topology of residues is always defined by the mmCIf chemical compound 
# definitions with the same name (if any). If e.g. atom names conflict between 
# this file and the mmCIf Chemical Compound definitions, the mmCif topologies take 
# precedence (and this file should be fixed to match).

# All existing  mmCif variant codes and their NEF equivalents are given in the companion
# file, mmCif_NEF_variant_mapping.txt
#
# Note : The side chain deprotonated variants of Ser, Thr, and Trp that are given in the 
# mmCif are not included in the present file, because they are not mandatory to support.
# Their topology and NEF variant codes follow from the companion file and the mmCif
# topology files.

All residues above are given in the linking form (linking code 'middle').
Chain terminating forms differ as follows:

NB - conforming programs must be able to *read* all the variant codes, but may convert them to a
different representation inernally. For free residues (linking 'single') especially, some programs
may well choose to convert all variants to a single template with default protonation state.


Amino acids:
- The N-terminal form (linking code 'start') has the backbone 'H' replaced by 'H1', 'H2', 'H3', with
additional wildcard expressions 'H%'. Also, for each variant there is an additional variant
with deprotonated amino terminal (code "-H3")
- The C-terminal form has an extra 'Std form atom' 'OXT' and an extra 'Additional atom' 'HXT'.
Also, for each variant there is an additional variant with protonated carboxy terminal (code "+HXT")
- The non-linked form (linking code 'single') has the extra atoms and variant codes of both the 'start' 
and 'end' forms.

See the worked examples for CYS  and PRO (below) for illustrations.

Nucleotides:
- 5' terminal nucleotides (linking code 'start') lack the phosphate group in the default state. 
- 'start' linking forms for the eight standard nucleotides are given below.
  Each has a supported variant that includes the phoptae, with variant code "-HO5',+P,+OP1,+OP2.+OP3"
- The 3' terminus (linking code 'end') has an extra 'Std form atom': HO3'
- The non-linked form (linking code 'single') has two extra 'Std form atom's: OP3 and HO3'.
  and an extra 'additional atom': HOP3

For non-standard residues, the standard uses the RCSB chemical compounds, as they stand, as the default form, 
and has no supported variant codes.



It is possible to make variants freely with atoms either added or removed. 
When adding atoms that are not in the 'Additional atoms' list, their bonds must be specified explicitly.
There is no obligation on programs to interpret non-standard residues or non-standard variants.
