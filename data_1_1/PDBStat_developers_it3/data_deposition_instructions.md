To upload data to the Github repository you need to have a GitHub username and password. 

1. From your login go to NEF folder on GitHub at
https://github.com/NMRExchangeFormat/NEF

2. Create a Fork of NEF by clicking on 'FORK' - this is a copy of the NEF folder at that time. You can make changes to this and then request these changes to be included in NEF (eg upload the example data files).

3. Go to your FORKed repository folder within: 
/NEF/data_1_1/PDBStat_developers_it3

4. Click upload files - then drag and drop the files and click 'commit changes' - please include a description of the file and changes

This only changes your FORK

5. To transfer to the main NEF fork you must issue a Pull request.
Click Pull requests > New Pull Request

"Base" repository should be NMRExchangeFormat/NEF
"Base" master 
"Head" repository is your fork of the NEF data
"Compare" is your branch (which is probably 'master')

It should say:
'Able to merge. These branches can be automatically merged.'

Below this you will see a list of the changes that you will make

6. If you are happy then click "Create Pull request" green button.

You can leave a comment (optional).

7. Once an administrator approves your change it will be included in the main repository for others to access.
