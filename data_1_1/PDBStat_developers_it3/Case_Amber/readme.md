Directory for wwPDB NMR Restraint Validation Project data.

Notes,  09 Nov 2020:

1. This is a partial dump of NEF results from Amber.  More are coming.

2. Amber doesn't modify input restraints, and doesn't write restraint
      files (in any format).  Hence the requests to output .nef files
      were ignored.

3. In place of a full attempt at structure determination, what is
      reported here is just energy minimization (with restraints) from the
      input structures provided.  This offers a partial deonstration
      that the input restraints are being read correctly.
