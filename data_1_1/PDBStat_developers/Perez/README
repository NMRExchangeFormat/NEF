Second stage: 
1. read initial NEF file,
2. MELD only handles NOESY and torsion data
    a. solves Hydrogen ambiguity by tracing to heavy atoms and adding 1 to distance
    b. write new nef file with data we used

3. Run 1000 MELD steps, cluster and submit 10 structures from top population cluster
    a. use pdb_extract to convert pdb to mmcif format

4. TODO: Our protocols show room for improvement, which we will pursue.
    a. Remove number of replicas used (30 currently)
    b. change REMD protocol to favor exchanges
    c. Runs take under 2 hours to complete
