Each developer has an allocated folder (named with developer surname) located in 
https://github.com/NMRExchangeFormat/NEF/tree/master/data_1_1/PDBStat_developers
where the data should be deposited (as described in data_deposition_instructions file).

If possible, the generated NEF files should be named in the following way: 

PDBcode_program_it1.nef

Example:
1pqx_Xplor-NIH_it1.nef

If you have more files for each PDB case, please provide a brief description in a separate text file.
