NEF Consortium Charter
======================

# 1 Preamble
NEF denotes the Nmr Exchange Format. The purpose of the NEF consortium is to
establish, maintain, and distribute the NEF format for NMR data exchange
together with related specifications and utilities. The consortium is committed
to provide the NEF format in a free and open form, and to support program-
specific extensions.

The NEF consortium relies on consensus between the participants as the only
possible basis for a successful project.The charter therefore has only minimal
provision for dealing with disputes.

In order to be accepted by all participants, it is important that the NEF does
not appear to be the 'property' of any single organisation. For this reason the
charter allows for the division of tasks between multiple organisations.


# 2 Consortium Organisation
The organs of the consortium are the Assembly of members, the Executive Committee
and Chairperson, the Secretariat, and the Specifications Repository.

## 2.1 Assembly
The NEF project is governed by the Assembly of members, which is open to all
groups that maintain software or services in a relevant scientific area, and
that commit themselves to supporting the NEF format for data import and export.

The Assembly meets at least once a year, possibly by audio or video conference, or in the
form of an publicly accessible on-line discussion forum.
The meeting accepts the report of the Executive Committee, and selects the
membership of the Executive Committee, the Secretariat, and the
Specifications Repository. All appointments are for one year periods,
renewable indefinitely by subsequent Assmbly meetings. Assembly meetings must be
called at least two weeks in advance and made known to all registered members of
the Assembly.
The agenda and decisions of Assembly meetings are public.

Changes to the Consortium charter or to the membership are the sole prerogative
of the Assembly and cannot be delegated to the Executive Committee

All decisions of the Assembly, including on the invitation or exclusion of
members, are taken by consensus. Where consensus cannot be obtained, decisions
can be taken by a simple majority.

## 2.2 Executive Committee
Between meetings, the authority of the NEF is delegated to an Executive
Committee that acts on  behalf of the NEF consortium, consulting as necessary.
It is the task of the Executive Committee to guard, develop and promote the NEF
standard. The agenda and decisions of Executive Committee meetings are public.

Decisions of the Executive Committee can be overruled by a general
Assembly meeting, or by an extraordinary assembly meeting called for the
purpose. Any member of the Executive Committee can call an extraordinary
Assembly meeting.

## 2.3 Executive Committee Chair
The executive Committee selects its own Chairperson from among its members.
He/She chairs the Executive Committee and is responsible for calling Committee
meetings, and for reporting to the Assembly.

## 2.4 Secretariat
The Secretariat is responsible for maintaining the NEF web site and
documentation, for keeping the Assembly membership list, for registering format
change proposals, for maintaining the uniqueness of the tag prefixes
and for implementing the decisions of the Executive Committee.

## 2.4 Specifications Repository
The Specifications Repository is responsible for maintaining the formal format
specification, and for maintaining reference parsers and format validators.


# 3 Changes to the NEF
Changes and enhancements to the NEF can be proposed by all members of the
assembly. Changes and enhancements will be put forward in a structured fashion,
comprised of a time period for public discussion regarding the merit of the
proposed change/enhancement, a process of formal adoption/rejection, and an
agreed time period for implementation. Proper versioning of the NEF will
discriminate backward compatible minor changes from major, potentially
incompatible changes.


# 4 Namespaces
To ensure that every developer can adopt the NEF standard, prefixes to the tags
define unique namespaces. Prefixes are directly associated with a program,
program suite or the accepted NEF standard and can be used as seen fit,
provided it adheres to the NEF syntax. The secretariat assures the uniqueness
of the prefixes. Every developer can register a prefix with the secretariat
without the need for prior approval, provided the prefix is unique. The
Executive Committee can revoke an allocated prefix in case it is deemed
offensive, its usage inappropriate, creates confusion, or for other reasons
that present a detrimental effect to the integrity or implementation of the
standard.
